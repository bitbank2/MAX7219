// I purchased a 4-module unit of red 8x8 LED matrices. They're wired such that the leftmost module is the last
// in the chain and the bits are arranged such that the MSB is on the left and row 0 is the top row.
//
// This library contains a basic set of functions to initialize the modules, set the intensity, draw text in 2 font
// sizes and scroll a bitmap (which can contain text or any graphics you put there
//
// The modules are connected to the SPI clock and data lines as well as a digital output pin to control the latching
// of the data. The SPI CS line is not sufficient to properly control the loading of the data. Each module expects
// to receive 16-bits of data at a time with D15 sent first and D0 sent last. The data contains an instruction in
// D11-D8 and data for that instruction in D7-D0. In my case of 4 modules cascaded together, a data stream of
// 16 x 4 = 64 bits must be transmitted at a time to latch data to all modules simultaneously. The controllers
// randomly power up in test mode (all LEDs on at their brightest). For this reason, the init function disables
// test mode just in case.
//
// Each module shifts bits in and the next bit is shifted out. For example, in the case of my setup with 4 modules
